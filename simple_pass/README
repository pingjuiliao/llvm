## Each Directories is a small project

## The CMakeLists.txt has been customized to make the directory the project name !

## To create a new project,
        
        cp -r ./template ./My_New_Project

## Package :

# CMakeLists.txt

# pass.cpp       : the llvm pass file. It will be compiled to 
                    *.so file, which is the star of this project.

# fibonacci.c.in : the main program file. We don't really care 
                    about it. If we want to change it, modify 
                    the CMakeLists again.

# run.sh.in      : the command to run the pass is too long to 
                    retype everytime. Hence the bash script.

# ./bin/         : the binary compiled place, to compile the   
                    project...

        $ cd ./bin
        $ cmake ..
        $ make
        $ ./run.sh
